> This project contains a nova backend that can be used to train models or generate explanations for the models on a remote server.
The server api can be used either from the UI itself or as a standalone tool to just interact with an existing nova database.


## Features

- **Model Training:** Utilize the Nova backend to train machine learning models efficiently. Leverage its capabilities to handle various data sources, preprocess data, perform model training, and save trained models for future use.

- **Explainability:** Generate explanations for the trained models using the Nova backend. This feature helps to interpret and understand the decision-making process of the models, promoting transparency and trustworthiness.

- **Remote Server API:** The Nova backend exposes a server API, enabling seamless integration with other systems or applications. Interact with the backend programmatically to access its functionalities and leverage its power remotely.

- **User Interface (UI):** The project also includes a user-friendly UI *link to nova?* for interacting with the Nova backend. Utilize the UI to easily perform model training, explanation generation, and data management tasks.

- **Stand-Alone Tool:** In addition to the UI, the Nova backend can be used as a standalone tool. This means that even without the UI, you can still leverage its capabilities to interact directly with an existing Nova database, making it a versatile and flexible solution.

## Installation

## Stable Version

The recommended way of usage is to install the latest stable version of the package via PyPI using the following command:

```bash
pip install hcai-nova-server
````
This will install the latest stable version of the package along with its dependencies.

## Nightly Version
Alternatively, you can use the nightly version of the current GitHub dev-commit by installing the package via PyPI using the following command:
```bash
pip install hcai-nova-server-nightly
````
This will install the nightly version of the package, which may contain the latest features and updates that are not available in the stable version. Note that this version may not be as stable as the stable version.

We recommend using the stable version for production usage, and the nightly version for testing and experimentation purposes.
